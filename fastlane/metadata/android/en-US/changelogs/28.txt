Bug fix for opening album full-screen crashing

Use hardware acceleration (OpenGL! Shaders!) for image editing. Currently just trying to mimic the previous implementation, but this will provide building blocks for much cooler things later on :)

Tell us if something doesn't work right! (email, Mastodon)

There are also translation updates in this release :)
