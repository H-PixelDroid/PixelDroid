If you want to contribute to PixelDroid, you can do so in several ways:

# Translation

You can help to translate PixelDroid to your favourite language. Please do not submit Merge Requests directly, but use our weblate at https://weblate.pixeldroid.org/projects/pixeldroid/pixeldroid/ .

You can add a new language by using the "Start new translation" button on the bottom left of the page.

Before translating, please take a look at the [TRANSLATION.md](TRANSLATION.md) file for details and some guidance.

# Creating issues on the issue tracker

If you encounter a problem or have an idea about how to make PixelDroid better, you should make an issue about it on our [GitLab project](https://gitlab.shinice.net/pixeldroid/PixelDroid/-/issues). If you encountered a problem, please make sure to document how to reproduce it, and include screenshots if possible. If you are making a suggestion, please try to be detailed in your description.

# Contribute changes or fix bugs

You can also help us solve one of the existing issues, or improve the application in some other way, by contributing changes yourself. To do this you can fork the project and submit a Merge Request.

Before starting to work on an issue or an improvement, you can ask us on our Matrix channel (#pixeldroid:gnugen.ch) what we think, or make a comment on the relevant issue, so that we might point you in the right direction, and to make sure someone else is not already working on it.
