## Glossaries

When translating something containing a term specific to Pixelfed, PixelDroid, or the fediverse in general, be sure to add the items to the glossary of the language you are translating to, this helps to keep translating consistent. When translating, make sure to check the glossary to use the proper terms, and if you change an entry in the glossary make sure to also edit the entries containing that term.
